> Types for defining OpenAPI documents with StandardSchema shapes

- Single source of truth: define your API once and use the same types to generate documentation, client code, and runtime validation.
- Validator-agnostic: built with StandardSchema, so your types work seamlessly with any compatible validation library like Zod or Yup.
- Consistent contracts: reduce duplication and keep your documentation, runtime validation, and type definitions fully aligned.
